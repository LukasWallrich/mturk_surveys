# Run Qualtrics surveys on MTurk with R

I have been running academic surveys on MTurk a couple of times, but find myself figuring out the same issues every single time. Therefore, here a record of how it can be done, with a couple of quality control steps added to the basic procedure. For now, these are primarily my own notes for future reference, but if anyone else finds them helpful, that'd be great.

Suggestions for how to do any of this better are very welcome - raising an Issue is probably easiest, but feel free to email me: lukas.wallrich@gmail.com
